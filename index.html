            <ul>
                <li><span>**This will not be 100% accurate, please be extra careful when checking for Manufacture Date**</span></li>
                <li>Manufacture Date also called Sell-By-Date.</li>
                <li>If you're in 2023 and the can has number 0 means it was made in 2020, not the year it will expired (2030)</li>
                <li>If you see 15:54 this means time (3:54pm).</li>
                <li>Each soda product will have different shelf life (opened, stored in dry/cool area, refrigerated)</li>
                <li>Shelf life  can be 3, 6, 9, 12 months (unopened)</li>
                <li>Year list will update every 5 years, if it doesn't. Contact me.</li>
